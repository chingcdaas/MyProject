        <h1>Hello! I am Amber</h1>
        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>I was born in America because my family moved here. When I was a baby, I lost my hearing. When I was in Elementary and Middle school, it was called Milwaukee School for Sign Language. Then I moved to the deaf school at 14.
        </p>
        <h2>My Hometown</h2>
        <p>In my home, we usually feed the wild birds when they come. That weather is perfect. I have a garden with roses, and I take care of them. It is peaceful outside in the weather. There are animals that I see every day, so I love feeding them.

        </p>
        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I like painting how I feel, and I love being creative. I love playing video games because they are more fun and challenging. I love playing with my birds because they are smart and playful, but crazy. I like playing volleyball with my cousin and friends because I miss playing volleyball sports.</p>
